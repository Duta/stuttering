umm,
this should print:
Seq [
    Assign "a" (IntConst 3),
    Assign "b" (IntConst 4),
    Assign "c" (ABinary Add (Var "a") (Var "b")),
    If (RBinary Equal (Var "c") (IntConst 7))
       (Seq [Print (IntConst 1)])
       (Seq [Print (IntConst 0)]),
    Assign "i" (IntConst 10),
    While (RBinary Greater (Var "i") (IntConst 0))
          (Seq [
              Print (Var "i"),
              Assign "i" (ABinary Subtract (Var "i") (IntConst 1))
          ])
]
yeah...

basically
    umm,
    this is a
    multiline comment.
    yeah...

    a is like 3 plus 17 over 2?
    b is like negative 4 times 5?
    c is like a plus b?
    if 5 minus 1 equals 4
    or c equals 21 over 3
    and 12 is bigger than 2 then basically
        print 1
    so yeah otherwise basically
        print negative 0
    so yeah?

    i is like 10?
    while i is bigger than 0 basically
        print i?
        i is like i minus 1
    so yeah

    um, this is a single line comment.
so yeah
