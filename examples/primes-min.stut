basically totalPrimes is like 100? numPrimes is like 0? currentNum is like 2? while numPrimes is smaller than totalPrimes basically isPrime is like true? currentDivisor is like 2? while currentDivisor is smaller than currentNum over 2 basically if currentNum mod currentDivisor equals 0 then isPrime is like false otherwise basically so yeah? currentDivisor is like currentDivisor plus 1 so yeah? if isPrime then basically numPrimes is like numPrimes plus 1? print currentNum so yeah otherwise basically so yeah? currentNum is like currentNum plus 1 so yeah so yeah
