stuttering
==========

Stuttering is a simple language which attempts to parse how I (fail to) express ideas.

An example:

    basically
        umm,
        this is a
        multiline comment.
        yeah...

        a is like 3 plus 17 over 2?
        b is like negative 4 times 5?
        c is like a plus b?
        if 5 minus 1 equals 4
        or c equals 21 over 3
        and 12 is bigger than 2 then basically
            print 1
        so yeah otherwise basically
            print negative 0
        so yeah?

        i is like 10?
        while i is bigger than 0 basically
            print i?
            i is like i minus 1
        so yeah

        um, this is a single line comment.
    so yeah

[Stream of consciousness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)) style:

    basically a is like 3 plus 17 over 2? b is like negative 4 times 5? c is like a plus b? if 5 minus 1 equals 4 or c equals 21 over 3 and 12 is bigger than 2 then basically print 1 so yeah otherwise basically print negative 0 so yeah? i is like 10? while i is bigger than 0 basically print i? i is like i minus 1 so yeah so yeah

Some basics:

[Hello world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program):

    print "Hello, world!"

A few more "Hello!"s:

    print "Hello, " plus "world!"

    basically
        print "Hello, "?
        print "world!"
    so yeah

    basically
        hello is like "Hello, "?
        world is like "world!"?
        print hello plus world
    so yeah

Calculating the meaning of it all:

    basically
        theAnswer is like 10 plus 100 over 3 minus 1?
        print theAnswer
    so yeah
