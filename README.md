stuttering
==========

Stuttering is a simple language which attempts to parse how I (fail to) express ideas.

An example, generating the first 100 primes:

    basically umm,
    this program generates and
    prints the first 100 primes
    yeah...
        totalPrimes is like 100? um, this is the total number of primes to generate
        numPrimes is like 0?     um, this is the current number of primes generated
        currentNum is like 2?    um, this is the current number being checked for primality

        while numPrimes is smaller than totalPrimes
        basically um, determine if the current number is prime
            um, assume it is prime
            isPrime is like true?

            um, check if it has any divisors
            currentDivisor is like 2?
            while currentDivisor is smaller than currentNum over 2 basically
                if currentNum mod currentDivisor equals 0 then
                    isPrime is like false
                otherwise basically
                    um, do nothing
                so yeah?

                currentDivisor is like currentDivisor plus 1
            so yeah?

            um, if it's prime, print it
            if isPrime then basically
                numPrimes is like numPrimes plus 1?
                print currentNum
            so yeah otherwise basically
                um, do nothing
            so yeah?

            um, increment the current number
            currentNum is like currentNum plus 1
        so yeah
    so yeah

[Stream of consciousness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)) style:

    basically totalPrimes is like 100? numPrimes is like 0? currentNum is like 2? while numPrimes is smaller than totalPrimes basically isPrime is like true? currentDivisor is like 2? while currentDivisor is smaller than currentNum over 2 basically if currentNum mod currentDivisor equals 0 then isPrime is like false otherwise basically so yeah? currentDivisor is like currentDivisor plus 1 so yeah? if isPrime then basically numPrimes is like numPrimes plus 1? print currentNum so yeah otherwise basically so yeah? currentNum is like currentNum plus 1 so yeah so yeah

Some basics:

[Hello world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program):

    print "Hello, world!"

A few more "Hello!"s:

    print "Hello, " plus "world!"

    basically
        print "Hello, "?
        print "world!"
    so yeah

    basically
        hello is like "Hello, "?
        world is like "world!"?
        print hello plus world
    so yeah

Calculating the meaning of it all:

    basically
        theAnswer is like 10 plus 100 over 3 minus 1?
        print theAnswer
    so yeah

Making sure I don't forget my details:

    basically
        nineteen is like 19?
        bertie is like a struct?
        bertie's name is like "Bertie Wheen"?
        bertie's age is like nineteen?
        print bertie's name plus ": " plus bertie's age
    so yeah
